Got it! For GitHub, you can format the project structure and setup instructions using proper markdown so it displays nicely with code blocks and indentation. Here’s a version you can directly paste into your README.md:

## Project Structure

me-api-playground/
├─ backend/           # Node.js API, database models, routes, and controllers
├─ frontend/          # React frontend with components, pages, and styles
└─ README.md          # Project overview and setup instructions

---

## Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install

	•	Create a .env file with your MongoDB URI
	•	Seed the database with sample data:

node seed.js

	•	Start the backend server:

npm run dev

Frontend

cd frontend
npm install

	•	Ensure .env has VITE_API_URL pointing to the backend API
	•	Start the frontend server:

npm run dev

This will render nicely on GitHub with **folders indented as a tree**, and **commands in proper code blocks**.  

If you want, I can rewrite the **entire README** including features, tech stack, project structure, and setup **all in one neatly formatted file** ready to copy. Do you want me to do that?
